# The War is Over: Rails, javascript, and webpacker

## Setup

To setup up this repo they're are a couple of prerequisite. 

* Ruby 2.2+
* Rails 4.2+ (If you're on 5.1 it's even better!)
* Node.js 6.0+
* yarn 0.25.2+

Once you've cloned this down to your machine you'll need to run the following commands 

`bundle install`

`yarn install`

Once you've done that run `yarn test` you should be greeted with a failing test (don't worry we'll fix that).

When you want to run the app in development you'll need to run `rails s ` && `yarn start`.

## What do I do if I get lost?

If you get lost in the code along there are 4 branches for you to check out. 

`phase_zero` - All of the App tests written and the application configured and ready to go. 

`phase_one` - All of Form's tests will be written and ready 
to go. 

`phase_two` - All of CardContainers tests are written and ready to go

`phase_three` - All of Cards tests are written and ready to go. 

## Goals for today

My goal is to change your mind and show that JS may not be as bad you think it is. It may be frustrating but isn't programming frustrating? 
This app is as stripped down as possible. No CSS just javascript, react, tests, and webpack.
